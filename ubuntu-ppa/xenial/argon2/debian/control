Description: memory-hard hashing function - development files
 Argon2 is a password-hashing function that can be used to hash passwords
 for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.
 .
 There are two main versions of Argon2: Argon2i and Argon2d.
 Argon2i is the safest against side-channel attacks, while Argon2d provides
 the highest resistance against GPU cracking attacks.
 .
 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .
 This package contains headers and libraries for developing programs based
 on argon2.
